Todo list (Ordered by priority)
===============================
[ ?=question ] [ !=important ] [ I=inprogress ] [T=testing] [ X=completed]

(!) Block Explorer
    - (T) Block DataTable
    - (!) Immature blocks / Confirmation count

(!) More statistics 
    - (!) BTC Value of block at time of mining
    - (!) Average blocks per day, week, month for each coin
    - (!) Average time to find block
    
(?T?) Fix neoscrypt (Almost ready) [ LeshaCat: Is this not working? I am mining it lol ] 

(!) Pools page (pools.html) needs sortable datatable [ Leshacat ]

(!) Rewrite payments module + tests [ LeshaCat: Was looking at this module... (not rewrite, just add features, still pondering) ]

( ) Add option to make an manual payments rather than automatic (for pools with big network diff) [ LeshaCat: Will put control in Admin Panel that uses RPC call ]

( ) New frontend [ Are you changing the design? ]

( ) Move modules in one project 

(?) Write different log level at one time [ What do you mean...? ]

( ) Docker Image / Documentation [ LeshaCat ]

( ) Documentation [ LeshaCat ]

( ) MySQL/MariaDB/MongoDB options (one or all) as replacement for Redis ?

( ) Auto-Detect daemon.conf settings (if in default location) [ LeshaCat ]

Mark your name beside tasks you wish to work on, or are currently working on :)

If you are OK with it I can knock a bit off this list, and you could handle graphics/stats/modules/redis/init.js and code I can't figure out

Also I don't care to learn Redis, so adding new statistics or database options you will need to do.

I have many other ideas but not going to list here.

LeshaCat CURRENT Main focus: Block Explorer.
